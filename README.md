# Team-Profile-Generator
### Siddharth Desai

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a command-line base application to generate a team profile html page. The user will be prompted with a series of questions through the command line using Inquirer and their answers are later used to generate the HTML page. The profiles are broken down into three role types: manager, intern and engineer. The user is only allowed one manager however has the ability to add as many interns and engineers as desired. Once the user is done adding interns and engineer profiles they can select “Finish building my team” in the command line options and this will generate the final HTML team profile page.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
